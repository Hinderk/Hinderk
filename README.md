Hi, my name is **Hinderk**. I hold an advanced degree in Numerical Mathematics & have been working as a software developer ever since I left academia 20 years ago. Beyond that there is little else about me worth sharing with the rest of the Github community at present. I am here to improve my software development skills and learn a new thing or two about the craft. I hope some day one of my __private__ experiments & pet projects will reach a state of maturity that other people can actually benefit from the code I intend to upload onto this platform.
