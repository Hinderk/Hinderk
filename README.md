Hi, my name is @Hinderk and there is little else at present worth sharing with the rest of the Github community. I am here to improve my software development skills and learn a new thing or two about the craft. I hope some day one of my pet projects will reach a state of maturity that other people can actually benefit from the code I intend to upload onto this platform.
